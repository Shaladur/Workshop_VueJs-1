# Workshop VueJs-1

<h1>Introduction</h1>
Hi !!<br>
Welcome to our workshop. Today we are gonna learn the basic of VueJs.<br>
In order to not get lost during the Workshop, please follow the steps below.

<br>
<h2>Ressource</h2>

During this workshop, if you have difficulty to do any step, you can ask for help or you can also check the documentary of Vue vite. Here the link: https://vitejs.dev/

<br>
<h2>Step 0 : Installation</h2>

First, you need to install node !

```
npm create vite@latest
```

You can write anything for the name of your repository. The only thing you need to do is to choose Vue for the framework and then Javascript for the variant. Now you should be good to start your project, just do the last command show after creating the repository and you should be able to open in a certain localhost the project.

<br>
<h2>Step 1 : Create a new page and interact with it</h2>

How about beginning with a simple task, make a new page and make a button who allow you to go to this new page ?

Sound easy for you ?
Well, let's see that. But first, you need to download more package

```
npm vue-router
```
This package will allow to go to different page easily.

(Bonus)
For those who like to do more, how about making a router-link. You don't know how to make a router-link ? Well, it's time to learn it.
That package, I make you download should be very helpful in order to make that router-link, don't you think so ?

<br>
<h2>Step 2 : NavBar</h2>

I hope you have fun create this button (and maybe that router-link) but let's create something better like a NavBar and add the button you create on the previous step. (You guess it, more page to do but be free to make has many you want !!!)
I think that would be better to watch, don't you think so ? Well, it's not like you have something else to do so have fun and be creative.

<br>
<h2>Step 3 : Share variable</h2>
Now, we going to see how we can share information with variable. But first, in order to create share variable (or if you prefer the term global variable) we going to download more lib (that should be the last one, maybe...).

```
npm vuex
```

With this, you should be able to create share variable. Also, here another link in order to understand what we want to do : https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/state.html


<br>
<h2>Step 4 : Cards</h2>

On this step, you going to create a reusable Card component capable of displaying diverse information, such as images, titles, and descriptions. Utilize this component to exhibit a list of cards showcasing different content on a single page (We are out of image so just write some text component inside, if you know how to that first, well you can add anything after).


Bonus (Optional) :

Implement interactivity within the cards, allowing users to interact with each card individually

<h2>Step 5 : Bonus</h2>

Well, you reach the end of this workshop, we don't have more step or exercice you can do (for now) but that doesn't mean this is the end. You know the base of VueJs now
